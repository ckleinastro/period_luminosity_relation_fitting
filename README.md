period_luminosity_relation_fitting
==================================

Python codes that use a Bayesian linear regression fitting method to simultaneous fit multi-band period--luminosity relations (originally for RR Lyrae stars, but easily adapted to Cepheids). Also includes analysis scripts that collate the data and make plots to allow interpretation and continued experimentation.
